sinatra - the framework we're working with
haml - the templating language that HTML is made with
scss - the templating language our CSS is generated with
couchDB the way we store / retrive data
this is my first time with all of them also

start it by running *bundle install* then *ruby app.rb* in the directory, with luck and some magic everything should just work.
